# Hopson Land

This was one my first ever projects, thus the code for it questionable but I keep it here for memories.dc

It is an simple RPG where you walk around a field, encounter monsters and have a chance of leveling up.

## Building

SFML is required. This can downloaded from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

Every encounter is based in the main.cpp inside a function.

All monsters inherit from a base "monster" class.

The maps are named "Map X Y". This allows for simple transition between maps. Eg, when the player walks over a '>' tile, the X position of the map increases by one. Then I can just load up "Map Player::MapX Player::MapY" eg "Map 1 0"
